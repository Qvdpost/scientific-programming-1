# Scientific Programming 1

University of Amsterdam / Programming Lab / Version 4.0-beta

Welcome to this programming course! In the weeks ahead, you'll use the programming language Python while learning to solve scientific problems from several fields of science. This first part is intended for students who have no experience in programming at all. The course comprises four modules, wherein you learn about the Python language, but foremost about strategies you can use to solve complex problems. For each module below, you may choose one particular case study.

**Module 1**

- draw pyramids and calculate cash change using [<strong>algorithms</strong>](/algoritmen), or

- dive into [<strong>number theory</strong>](/getaltheorie).

**Module 2**

- calculate definite [<strong>integrals</strong>](/integreren) of complicated mathematical functions, or

- analyze text sources using [<strong>natural language processing</strong>](/nlp).

**Module 3**

- study the physics of [<strong>movement</strong>](/beweging), or

- calculate your advantage when playing [<strong>Monopoly</strong>](/monopoly), or

- understand the equilibrium between [<strong>prey and predator</strong>](/prooi-predator/inhoud).

**Module 4**

- analyze  [<strong>weather extremes</strong>](/big-data) over the past century, or

- draw your own hard conclusions using [<strong>statistics</strong>](/statistiek/inhoud).
