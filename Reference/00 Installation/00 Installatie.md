# How to install Python


Python is an environment that can be installed to your own computer, or used via an online service. We provide you with some instructions for both options:

* [Installing on you own computer](/reference/installation-computer) is of course very gratifying, because you can get to work at any time, also when you're done with the course.

* [Using an online service](/reference/installation-online) is a fair bit easier. Especially if you run into any trouble when installing your own computer, you can at least get get to work quickly online. The environment we recommend is theoretically free to use forever.

Are you completely stuck? Don't hesitate to send us an [email](mailto:inleiding@mprog.nl) so we can help you along. Even if you're not registered for the course we can help you get Python to work for you!

## Already have Python?

Tip: if you already have Python, give this a thought:

* Check whether you have to correct version! Python 2 and Python 3 exist alongside one another. We use the latest version, Python 3.

* Be sure to install the program `checkpy`. Head over to the instructions for installing on your [own computer](/reference/installation-computer)
