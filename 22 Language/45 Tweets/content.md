# Summarizing and plotting a corpus

We have provided a text file with a selection of tweets from a famously grumpy actor. Can our analysis confirm that he's most often tweeting about what he doesn't like? Let's see.

> **Task**: write a program that reads in a selection of texts, calculates each text's sentiment, and summarizes the results in a pie chart.

Your program should comprise three parts:

1. Load the file with tweet on each line. To do this, you need to use this code:

       with open("tweets.txt") as tweet_file:
   	       tweets = tweet_file.readlines()

   Your `tweets` variable will then contain a list of strings, each string being a single tweet.

2. Calculate the sentiment of each tweet, keeping track of the number of positive as well as the negative and neutral tweets. Which loop strategies can you use to do this?

3. Take the calculated numbers and use these to make a nice pie chart: [matplotlib.pyplot.pie â€” Matplotlib 3.1.0 documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.pie.html#matplotlib.pyplot.pie). The chart should have three parts: positive, negative and neutral. Also make sure the chart has descriptive labels and appropriate colors! Have a look at the Matplotlib docs.
